## A completely barebones terminal made in JavaScript

chiTTY is an extremely barebones terminal, there's not even copy and paste functionality.

If you're a Linux elitist who thinks that all the fancy terminals of today like GNOME Terminal and Hyper are a fad, this is for you!

# Installation

If you want to install chiTTY, I'd strongly recommend against it unless you're a masochist. If you are, you can go to the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/samuelolagunju/chiTTY/releases) and download the correct binary for your OS

If you have any problems with that, you can report an issue in the issues tab (you need a GitHub account for this)
